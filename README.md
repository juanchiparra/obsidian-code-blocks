## What is syntax highlighting?

Syntax highlighting is a function that transforms code into a more intuitive visual language. Differentiating keywords, variables, and functions, among other elements with different colors, significantly improves the readability and comprehension of the code. This allows you to read the code faster and more fluently, quickly identify key elements, and better understand the structure and logic of the program.

## What are snippets?

Snippets are predefined code that you can use to modify the appearance of your Obsidian workspace.
